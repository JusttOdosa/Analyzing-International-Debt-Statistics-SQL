# International Debt Analysis

## Overview

Managing debt is not only essential for individuals but also for countries. Infrastructure spending, for instance, often necessitates countries to acquire debt. The World Bank serves as a key organization that provides debt to countries. In this project, we delve into an analysis of international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset includes detailed information about the debt amounts (in USD) owed by developing countries across various categories. The objective is to answer critical questions, such as the total amount of debt owed by the countries, the country with the highest debt, and the average debt across different debt indicators.

## Questions to Explore

1. What is the total amount of debt owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
2. Which country owns the maximum amount of debt, and what is the corresponding amount?
3. What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

## Data Source

The data used in this project is sourced from The World Bank. It encompasses national and regional debt statistics for numerous countries worldwide, recorded between 1970 and 2015.
